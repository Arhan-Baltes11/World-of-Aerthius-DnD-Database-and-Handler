# World-of-Ærthius-DnD-Database-and-Handler

### Project started on 28/10/2024

### Updated on 28/10/2024

So a long time ago, about a few sessions ago, I figured I might as well make a more simplified tracker on my notes and stuff. So I asked: "Why not make a database on it? And have a program that keeps track of everything in the world with it?", well, here's a program just for that, written in .NET.

A Razor equivalent will happen eventually.

And, I know it's called Ærthius. Github wouldn't pick up the repository otherwise.

## Requirements:

.NET 8.0
Any SQL database

## Usage:

For the console:
- Navigate to the console towards the `Aerthius Console` Directory
- `dotnet run`

## Current planning:

### Add classes to the project
Classes like Players for party members, HistFigures with NPC and Enemies with perhaps inheritance to the class?
Although, it might be unnecessary seeing as this is more or less an archiving database that collects data based on set parameters.
