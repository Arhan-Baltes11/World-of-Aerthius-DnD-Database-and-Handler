# World-of-Ærthius-DnD-Database-and-Handler

### Project started on 28/10/2024

### Updated on 28/10/2024

So a long time ago, about a few sessions ago, I figured I might as well make a more simplified tracker on my notes and stuff. So I asked: "Why not make a database on it? And have a program that keeps track of everything in the world with it?", well, here's a program just for that, written in .NET.

A Razor equivalent will happen eventually.

And, I know it's called Ærthius. Github wouldn't pick up the repository otherwise.

## Current planning:

### Plan out the way the program handles things
This includes a class UML, a database, how the database is organised, etc.

### Create a .NET project for this repository
Obviously, we would use `dotnet new console -n (name)` to make a folder containing all sorts of projects. I'm doing it in the following way so that I probably won't have to worry about files coming together when I eventually make a Razor version as well.
